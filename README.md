# PyTimeHop
A python script that retrieves all jpg/jpeg files recursively from any directory, with a created date of today's day in all prior years, and generates an html file of all the files found.   Much like the Timehop app, but very basic.   I will likely improve upon it over time, but for now, this gets me what i'm looking for, which is any photos created on today's date in the past.
